Carbon Emissions, a huge problem that we have been dealing with since the industrial revolution. Contributing tour very fast growing **Carbon Emissions**, ranging from cars, motorcycles and powerplants.

Since the industrial evolution in the 1700's, the number of carbon dioxide (CO²) we have been emitting has increased by over 40%, from an average 280ppm (parts per million) in the 1700's, to 414ppm in 2021.

Normally, the carbon in our atmospere is kept at a stable level thanks to trees, but overtime, us humans cut the trees off to benefit of the trees we cut.

The amazon rainforest, which is estimated to have over 320 billion number of trees, sucks up more than 2 billion tons of co², that is only 5% of what we actually emmit, a sign that we're putting too much carbon in our atmospere.

Thankfully there had been solutions to such problems, like the tesla electric vehicle which 

How can we slow down or stop Climate Change?, reduce our carbon emission, plant more trees.
