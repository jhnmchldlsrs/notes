Hello everyone, we are group four, and today, we'll be discussing and contrasting 4 out of the seven stages in the story written by William Shakesphere, The seven ages of man.

Starting with the infant.

[ INFANT ]

The infant is where everything begins, its where the story begins, this is the exact time that you will start to perform in the stage or in the world.

In the story, this is described to be the stage where the actor or the person is "mewling and puking", or is dependant on the nurse's nurturing.

[ SCHOOLBOY ]
Now the school-boy, described as "creeping like snail".

This is where the infant has grown to go to school, but is unwilling to. quote "creeping like snail unwillingly to school".

Comparing it to the infant, the school boy is much more capable of doing stuff, as described by ma'am Melrose, the school boy can make desicions on his own, hence being more capable.

[ LOVER ]
Next, the lover. The lover's age is depicted as a stage filled with sighs and romantic pursuits.
It's a time of passion, idealism, and intense emotions.

This stage often occurs during young adulthood, usually in the actors late teens to early twenties, although it can change at any age.

[ OLD AGE ]
The last is the Old Age or the Twilight Years.

Old age is described as a stage when the actor is "sans teeth, sans eyes, sans everything."
It shows physical decline. It's marked by loss, dependency, and the passage of time.

this serves as a reflection on the challenges that individuals face as they get closer to the end of their life. It shows the physical decline, dependency, and the very long time the actor has lived. 

Now to sum it all up.
- **The Infant** - the stage where everything starts.
- **The school-boy** - he's more capable, disciplined, and is starting to go to school.
- **The lover** - full of romantic pursuits.
- **Old Age** - stage of physical decline

And that is all the info we we're able to gather, thank you everyone for listening, and may we all have a wonderfull afternoon.
