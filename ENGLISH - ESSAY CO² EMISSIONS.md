Carbon Emissions, a huge problem that we have been dealing with since the industrial revolution. Contributing to our very fast growing **Carbon Emissions** range from cars, motorcycles and powerplants. Since the industrial evolution in the 1700's, the number of carbon dioxide (CO²) we have been emitting has increased by over 40%, from an average 280ppm (parts per million) in the 1700's, to 414ppm in 2021. China, being one of the leading contries to emmit CO², accounted for nearly 33% percent of the global CO² emissions in 2021, thats over 11.9 billion tonnes of co2, together with the other top 4 countries, they are responsible for over 60% of global emissions.

Normally, the carbon in our atmospere is kept at a stable level thanks to trees, but overtime, us humans cut the trees off to benefit of the trees we cut. The amazon rainforest, which is estimated to have over 320 billion trees, absorbs more than 2 billion tons of co². That only represents 5% of what we actually emmit, a sign that we're putting too much carbon in our atmospere.

Overtime, the rising levels of CO² will cause global warming, that today we are allready experiencing. If we continue to release more co², we risk intensifying a natural greenhouse effect.

Take the planet Venus for example, somewhere between 200 Million and 3 Billion years ago. The planet had too much carbon in its atmosphere causing a runaway greenhouse effect to occur. To this day, planet venus has a dry surface with no water and surface temperatures going up to 900°F (Degrees Farenheit) or 475°C (Degrees Celsius).

How can we combat this problem? The easiest way to do this is by **planting new forests (afforestation) or restoring old ones (reforestation)**. Or use new technologies that suck CO2 out of the air (direct air capture), or prevent it from leaving smokestacks (carbon capture and storage).

In conclusion, monitoring our carbon emissions is vital for our safety and the well-being of our planet. From the alarming rise in CO² levels lead by the industrial revolution, To the amazon rainforest, being a vital carbon absober, that can only absorb a fraction of what we emmit.
Solutions like planting new trees or repopulating old cut down forests might be our key to stop this problem.
With that being said, in a world where every life depends on our mother earth, every descision matters.
