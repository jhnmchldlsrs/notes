1. About me:
Hello! Im Michael. a 13 year old student who loves Music, Writing and Software Engineering. Im the youngest among the two of my siblings. I also have a like for Aviation related stuff.

2. The people i love:
The drawing at the right represents all my friends, peers and loved ones. They are all lovely and i love them all, Though i dont always have the time to be with them. So everytime that they're around, i always try to make the most of the time with them. Even though sometimes all of them dont go together well, I find the happiest of every bit of the moment worth it.

3. The things i love:
The drawing at the side is a computer, You instruct it what to do and it does what 
you instruct it. Me as a kid, i've always
been fascinated by how a computer works and all sorts of stuff you can instruct 
it to do. Everytime when i have nothing
to do or have a free time, i would always 
go to the computer to instruct it and 
always be amazed of what it can do.

4. Something interesting about me:
The drawing on the right is called a code-tag, it is an illustration commonly used to symbolize programming. While being fascinated of the computer, I discovered something called programming, it is when you type code or instructions to automate a task of which a computer executes to provide a desired user output. Since my discovery of programming i have been more amazed by the computer, so out of boredom, me decided to learn programming in the middle of the pandemic. i have been programming for over 5 years and i've learned so much.
