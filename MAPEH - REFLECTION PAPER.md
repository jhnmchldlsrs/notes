I liked Handël's Concerto Grosso more because all of the instruments that are used in his compositions just blend together so well. A lot of instruments are used in his compositions which makes it sound a lot richer and is why i prefer it.

The thing that i notice is that they both use violins. I've allso noticed that most of Vivaldi's compositions sounds a little faster compared to Handël's, this is also the reason why i prefer Handël's compositions.
