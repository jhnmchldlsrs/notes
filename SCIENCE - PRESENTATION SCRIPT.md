Hello good morning we are here to present our project.

Here, we have a representation of the circulatory system. And today, we'll be explaining each part of the system, what it does, and it's specific function.

We'll be explaining 3 organs in the system.
The heart, The blood vessels and the blood.

But first what is the circulatory system?

The circulatory system is a complex system that is essential for life. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to the cells and tissues of the body, and it removes waste products. The circulatory system is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.

Lets start with the main part of the system, The heart. What is it?

The heart is the central organ of the circulatory system. To the end of its life, its only purpose is to pump blood throughout the body to keep u alive. The heart has four chambers: two ventricles and two atrias. The ventricles are the lower chambers of the heart. They pump blood out of the heart. The atria are the upper chambers of the heart. They receive blood from the vein.

Next we have the blood vessels, theres three types of blood vessels though only two are represented here. They are the Arteries and Veins.

Notice that we have two different colored strings?

The red yarns in the representation represent the arteries. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body, of which then the body cells use.

The blue yarns represent the veins. Veins is like the oppposite of the Ateries. Instead of carrying oxygen rich blood, Veins carry oxygen-poor or deoxegenated blood back to the heart for re-oxygenation.

They all different in their ways, but they all have the same purpose, To circulate blood around the body.

Blood carries the nutrients, oxygen and other essential stuff that the body needs. Without it, thr body would starve and die due to lack of nutrients. it is a fluid that circulates through the body. It is made up of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Plasma is the liquid part of blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the tissues. White blood cells fight infection. Platelets help to clot blood.

With that being said.

The circulatory system is a very very important system that keeps us alive. It is important to take care of it by not pushing the system too far.
