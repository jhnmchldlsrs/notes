Hello good morning we are here to present our project.

Here, we have a representation of the circulatory system. And today, we'll be explaining each part of the system, what it does, and it's specific function.

We'll be explaining 3 organs in the system.

Lets start with the main part of the system, The heart. What is it?

As the central part of the circulatory system, the heart is responsible for **pumping blood, supplying oxygen and nutrients, and removing metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide from all the tissues in the body**

Next we have the blood vessels, theres three types of blood vessels though only two are represented here. They are the Arteries and Veins.

Lets start with the Arteries, Arteries are a critical part of our cardiovascular system, Arteries are blood vessels that **distribute oxygen-rich blood to your entire body**. They carry blood away from the heart to your body. These tube-like vessels and the muscles inside them ensure your organs and tissues have the oxygen and nutrients they need to function.

Next the veins, Unlike the Arteries, the Vein moves blood to the heart. Generally, veins **carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart**, where it can be sent to the lungs to get re-oxygenated. The exception is the network of pulmonary veins, which take oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart.
